Here’s an enhanced prompt that includes **API integration** for receipt scanning in the Odoo expense claim module:  

---

### **Prompt: Odoo Expense Claim Add-on with Receipt Scanning (OCR API Integration)**  

Develop an **Odoo Expense Claim Add-on Module** named `hr_expense_claim_auto_scan` that allows users to upload a receipt and automatically extracts expense details using an **OCR API**. The extracted data should populate the expense claim form automatically.  

---

### **1. Module Overview**  
- Extend the `hr.expense` model to support automatic receipt scanning.  
- Integrate an **OCR API** to extract structured receipt data.  
- Auto-fill extracted details into the expense claim form.  
- Allow users to review and edit the extracted data before submission.  

---

### **2. Features & Requirements**  

#### **1. Receipt Upload & API Processing**  
- Modify the expense form to allow users to attach a receipt image (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`).  
- When a user uploads a receipt, trigger an **API call** to extract receipt details.  
- Use the API to retrieve structured data in JSON format.  

#### **2. API Integration for OCR**  
- The module should send the receipt image to the OCR API using a POST request.  
- API Endpoint Example:  
  ```
  POST https://api.example.com/receipt-ocr
  Headers:
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data
    API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
  Body:
    file: (receipt image file)
  ```
- The API will return structured JSON data:  
  ```json
  {
    "business_name": "SuperMart",
    "receipt_number": "INV-56789",
    "date": "2025-03-16",
    "items": [
      {
        "quantity": 2,
        "description": "Milk",
        "amount": 5.00
      },
      {
        "quantity": 1,
        "description": "Bread",
        "amount": 3.00
      }
    ],
    "subtotal": 8.00,
    "tax": 0.64,
    "total_amount": 8.64
  }
  ```

#### **3. Auto-Fill Expense Form**  
- Map the extracted data to `hr.expense` fields:  
  - `business_name` → `partner_id` (Vendor)  
  - `date` → `date`  
  - `total_amount` → `total_amount`  
  - `items` → `expense_lines`  

#### **4. User Confirmation & Editing**  
- Show extracted details in a form preview.  
- Allow users to manually adjust the details before submitting the expense.  

#### **5. Logging & Error Handling**  
- Handle cases where the API fails or returns incomplete data.  
- Log API responses for debugging.  

---

### **3. Expected Code Implementation**  

#### **1. Models (`models/hr_expense.py`)**  
- Extend `hr.expense` to handle receipt upload and API processing.  
- Store extracted details in additional fields.  

#### **2. Views (`views/hr_expense_view.xml`)**  
- Modify the expense form to include:  
  - Receipt upload field  
  - Extracted data preview  

#### **3. Controller (`controllers/main.py`)**  
- Create an API endpoint to send uploaded receipts to the OCR API.  
- Handle the API response and update the expense claim.  

#### **4. OCR API Service (`services/ocr_service.py`)**  
- A helper function to send receipt images to the API and parse the JSON response.  

Example function:  
```python
import requests

def process_receipt_ocr(file_path):
    url = "https://api.example.com/receipt-ocr"
    headers = {"API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
    files = {"file": open(file_path, "rb")}

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)
    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None
```

---

### **4. Example Workflow**  

1. **User Action**: Uploads a receipt in the expense claim form.  
2. **API Request**: Odoo sends the image to the OCR API.  
3. **API Response**: Extracted data is returned in JSON format.  
4. **Auto-Population**: Expense form fields are updated with extracted details.  
5. **User Confirmation**: The user reviews and submits the expense.  

---

### **5. Additional Enhancements (Optional)**  
- Add **multi-currency support** based on extracted receipt currency.  
- Implement a **background job** for OCR processing using Odoo’s `queue_job` module.
